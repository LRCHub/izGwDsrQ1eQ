Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind ignorance is kind
But there's no comfort in the truth
Pain is the all you'll find

Shoulda' known better, yeah

Oh-oo, oh-oo, oh
Oh-oh
Mmh

I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind the silver screen
And all its sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
Oh-oh

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is the all you'll find

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should've known better than to cheat a friend (should've known better, yeah)
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh

Never without your love

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now, who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay

And I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Oh-oh

(Now that you're gone) now that you're gone
(Now that you're gone) was what I did so wrong, so wrong
That you had to leave me alone?

Now that you're gone
Was what I did so wrong
Do-da, bo-da-ah, ah-ah
Do-da, bo-ah-ah
Do-da, bo-da-ah, ah-ah
Do-da, bo-da-ah
Do-da, bo-da-ah
