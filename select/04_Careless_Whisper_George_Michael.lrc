[00:16.14] Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[00:23.64] 
[00:27.68] I feel so unsure
[00:33.44] As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
[00:40.43] As the music dies, something in your eyes
[00:46.45] Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes
[01:13.45] 
[00:53.20] I'm never gonna dance again
[00:55.69] Guilty feet have got no rhythm
[00:59.37] Though it's easy to pretend
[01:01.83] I know you're not a fool
[01:13.83] 
[01:05.14] I should've known better than to cheat a friend
[01:08.13] And waste the chance that I'd been given
[01:11.81] So I'm never gonna dance again
[01:14.49] The way I danced with you, oh-oh
[01:30.49] 
[01:30.32] Time can never mend
[01:36.53] The careless whispers of a good friend
[01:43.27] To the heart and mind, ignorance is kind
[01:49.25] There's no comfort in the truth, pain is that all you'll find
[02:19.75] 
[01:56.02] I'm never gonna dance again
[01:58.53] Guilty feet have got no rhythm
[02:02.19] Though it's easy to pretend
[02:04.80] I know you're not a fool
[02:16.80] 
[02:07.70] I should've known better than to cheat a friend (I should've known better, yeah)
[02:10.94] And waste the chance that I'd been given
[02:14.67] So I'm never gonna dance again
[02:17.17] The way I danced with you, oh-oh
[02:33.17] 
[02:26.09] Never without your love
[02:37.59] 
[02:45.73] Tonight the music seems so loud
[02:48.88] I wish that we could lose this crowd
[02:52.29] Maybe it's better this way
[02:55.27] We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
[03:20.77] 
[02:58.44] We could have been so good together
[03:01.63] We could have lived this dance forever
[03:04.74] But now, who's gonna dance with me?
[03:09.67] Please stay
[03:15.17] 
[03:11.86] I'm never gonna dance again
[03:14.40] Guilty feet have got no rhythm
[03:18.08] Though it's easy to pretend
[03:20.54] I know you're not a fool
[03:32.54] 
[03:23.87] I should've known better than to cheat a friend
[03:26.80] And waste the chance that I'd been given
[03:30.48] So I'm never gonna dance again
[03:33.18] The way I danced with you, oh-oh
[03:49.18] 
[03:49.81] (Now that you're gone) now that you're gone
[04:11.31] 
[04:02.77] (Now that you're gone) was what I did so wrong, so wrong
[04:10.01] That you had to leave me alone?
