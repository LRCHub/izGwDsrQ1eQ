[01:52.75] I feel so unsure
[01:59.28] As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
[02:05.42] As the music dies
[02:08.52] Something in your eyes
[02:11.53] Calls to mind the silver screen
[02:14.38] And all its sad goodbyes
[02:26.38] 
[02:18.23] I'm never gonna dance again
[02:20.00] Guilty feet have got no rhythm
[02:23.72] Though it's easy to pretend
[02:26.73] I know you're not a fool
[02:38.73] 
[02:29.98] I Should've known better than to cheat a friend
[02:33.17] And waste a chance that I'd been given
[02:36.66] So I'm never gonna dance again
[02:39.79] The way I danced with you... oh oh
[02:56.79] 
[02:55.13] Time can never mend
[03:01.87] The careless whispers of a good friend
[03:08.06] To the heart and mind ignorance is kind
[03:13.65] There's no comfort in the truth
[03:18.13] Pain is that all you'll find
[03:32.13] 
[03:21.15] I'm never gonna dance again
[03:23.64] Guilty feet have got no rhythm
[03:27.20] Though it's easy to pretend
[03:29.96] I know you're not a fool
[03:32.67] I Should've known better than to cheat a friend
[03:34.61] (I Should' ve known better, yeah)
[03:36.58] And waste a chance that I'd been given
[03:39.45] So I'm never gonna dance again
[03:42.11] The way I danced with you, ooh
[03:57.11] 
[03:51.43] Never without your love
[04:02.93] 
[04:11.31] Tonight the music seems so loud
[04:13.77] I wish that we could loose this crowd
[04:17.19] Maybe it's better this way
[04:20.19] We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
[04:23.29] We could have been so good together
[04:26.43] We could have lived this dance forever
[04:29.84] But now, who's gonna dance with me
[04:34.48] Please stay
[04:39.98] 
[04:36.66] And I'm never gonna dance again
[04:39.24] Guilty feet have got no rhythm
[04:43.30] Though it's easy to pretend
[04:45.79] I know you're not a fool
[04:48.73] I Should've known better than to cheat a friend
[04:51.78] And waste a chance that I'd been given
[04:55.25] So I'm never gonna dance again
[04:58.02] The way I danced with you, oh oh
[05:14.02] 
[05:14.71] Now that you're gone
[05:18.42] Now that you're gone
[05:28.42] 
[05:27.59] Now that you're gone
[05:30.37] Was what I did so wrong
[05:33.85] So wrong
[05:35.74] That you had to leave me alone
